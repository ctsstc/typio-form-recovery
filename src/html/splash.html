		<p>This version of Typio has been in the works for quite some time and it brings lots of improvements and a couple of new features. If you enjoy using Typio, you can now also support the development by <a style="white-space: nowrap" href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/typio" target="_blank">buying me a hot coffee!</a></p>

		<p>Here's what's new!</p>

		<ul>
			<li><span class="change">Change:</span> The Quick Restore popup will no longer show for contentEditable fields. These fields are known to not function as they should after restoring into them. Typio will no longer automatically restore data into these fields because there is no safe way of doing it. Your data can still be accessed from the Recovery Window and can be manually restored by copying and pasting it.</li>
			<li><span class="new">New:</span> Better support for re-usable input fields (common in chat applications)</li>
			<li><span class="new">New:</span> Better support for state based applications (React, Vue, Angular etc)</li>
			<li><span class="new">New:</span> The Quick Restore Icon now re-positions with input fields if they change in size</li>
			<li><span class="new">New:</span> Focus is now restored to the input after using the Quick Restore Popup to restore</li>
			<li><span class="new">New:</span> More accurate text preview in the Recovery Window.</li>
			<li><span class="new">New:</span> Improved copy function with better whitespace handling</li>
			<li><span class="new">New:</span> Updated FAQ page with more information</li>
			<li><span class="new">New:</span> The options page has been rewritten from ground up</li>
			<li><span class="new">New:</span> The entire extension has been refactored to es6 modules and the build process has been updated and improved.</li>
			<li><span class="fix">Fix:</span> Fix Recovery Window stuck at "loading entries" forever</li>
			<li><span class="fix">Fix:</span> Fix collision with some embedded video players</li>
			<li><span class="fix">Fix:</span> Fix edge cases with iframe editors</li>
			<li><span class="fix">Fix:</span> Radio buttons are now saved and restored more reliably</li>
			<li><span class="fix">Fix:</span> Lots of other bug fixes and preparation for future releases</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Please note that you need to refresh any currently open web pages in order for Typio to function after updating.</p>
