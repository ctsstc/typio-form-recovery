            <p>The main purpose of Typio is to backup and restore form input data. In order for Typio to do this it needs to save your form input as you enter it. Any user input Typio stores is stored only for the purpose of restoration and is never uploaded to any servers. <strong>Your data stays on your computer.</strong></p>
            <p>You are in control of which sites Typio is enabled on and how long your data is stored. This can be configured in the extension options page.</p>
            <p>The source code for Typio is available to view on <a href="https://bitbucket.org/nicklassandell/chrome-form-recovery/src">Bitbucket</a>.</p>
