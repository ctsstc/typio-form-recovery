			<div id="no-field-focus" class="opt-group">
				<p class="opt-title">Error: Cannot find a focused input field</p>
				<p>You might encounter this error when attempting to open Quick Access with the icon or with the keyboard shortcut. This problem occurs when the input field is of a custom type (contenteditable) and the website manipulates the field. Typio is still active and working, but the Quick Access popup might not show, because Typio is unable to detect which input field to open the Quick Access for. You can access your data through the recovery dialog (right click anywhere > Open form recovery).</p>

			<div id="no-auto-restore" class="opt-group">
				<p class="opt-title">Error: Entry cannot be restored automatically</p>
				<p>The field the entry was typed in cannot be found on the current page. Either the field does not exist, or it cannot be found in the same place (path has changed). You can manually restore the entry by copying it.</p>
