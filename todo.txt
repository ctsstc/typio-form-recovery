* Test WYSIWYG support, test codepen and wordpress and froala
* Storage days in settings dialog should reflect sanitized value that runs
* Test storage performance with lots of data (writing should be unaffected)
* When recovering past session, should that be cloned into the new session? (e.g. should i trigger "onchange" on recovered inputs?) (compare old)
* Extensive testing of legacy storage conversion
* Manifest description
* Test on loads of sites, wait a couple days

New: Recovery dialog! Allows you to browse all saved data gives you advanced recovery options.
New: Flashes input fields when recovering (useful for recovering sessions).

Fixed: Saved passwords even when option was set to disabled in some cases
Fixed: "Delete all" should delete all except for current session
Fixed: Added support for "select" dropdowns
Fixed: Max storage days is now unlimited (bug prevented setting higher than 7 days)
Fixed: Better icon for "recover only this field" option in context menu

Changed: Faster. Now uses in memory storage with asynchronous flat file offloading.
Changed: Delete entry button removed from context menu. Entries can be deleted in recovery dialog instead.
