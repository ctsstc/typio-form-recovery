Fix: Deprecated multiple shadow roots in one parent. All injected html is now within one parent root.
Fix: Improved error message if trigger context before page load etc

Todo:
- Refactor everything
- Escape should close clicky thingy
- Concat all shadowroot css
- Concat all content js??
- Shadowdom support: https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/docs/devguide/feature-overview
	- Compare getpath old vs new to make sure no changes are found
- I don't think radios work correctly within iframes/shadowdom
