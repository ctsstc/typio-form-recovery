- Run in iframes (inject contentscript?)
	- Should add support for WYSIWYG editors, i think
- Add support for select elements, forgot about that
- Add right-click to whole page and not just inputs
	- Might cause issues with checkboxes/radios
- Add restore dialog where you can see all stored data per field (?)
